# Single Cycle RISC-V 32I Datapath.
The Single-Cycle RISC-V 32I Datapath, designed using Logisim, executes RV32I instructions in one clock cycle. It efficiently performs fetch, decode, execute, and write-back operations, streamlining the design. Rigorously tested on Logisim, it ensures accurate execution. A valuable contribution for learning and experimentation.
